Go viral in a vibrant community of 22M U.S. Military & Veterans. Protect your offer with instant identity verification by ID Services.

== Description ==

<p>This plugin connects your <a href="https://id.services">ID Services</a> account to offer a verified military discount in your WooCommerce store.</p>

**Why offer a military discount?**

<p>Companies have done it for decades: Home Depot, Advance Auto, 24 Hour Fitness, Foot Locker, Greyhound, Michael's, Payless Shoes â€” and hundreds more. These companies all realized the colossal marketing opportunity by supporting our nation's heroes.</p>
<ul>
<li>95% of military customers revisit a company offering a discount versus one who doesn't</li>
<li>22 million people eligible for this discount</li>
</ul>

**Requirements**
<ul>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li><a href="https://my.id.services/account" target="_blank">ID Services Account</a> ($9.99/mo. + 7-Day Trial)</li>
</ul>

**How does it work?**
<p>ID Services verifies military in a 3-step process using a popup to our secure verification popup inside your store. The plugin includes multiple auto-install options for adding a button or banner to your cart/checkout page.</p>

<ul>
<li>Possession of a verified ".mil" e-mail address serves as automatic verification. However,
Veterans (those who previously served) and many Active Duty (those currently serving) won't possess
this kind of e-mail.</li>
<li>Next, we can scan some non-sensitive information against a public database. Many Veterans
will be instantly approved, but many won't.</li>
<li>Finally, if neither instant method served as verification, we allow them to securely upload
a proof-of-service document to be verified by a qualified ID Services staff member. This typically
occurs in under 5 minutes during normal PST daylight hours, and documents are deleted simultaneously with a decision being made.</li>
</ul>

**Support**
<p>woocommerce@id.services</p>
